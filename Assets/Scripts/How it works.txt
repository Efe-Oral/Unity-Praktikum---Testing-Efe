Quick rundown of the Project

Step 1.
Open Windows PowerShell and run the command "ollama serve"

Step 2. 
Enter a prompt in unity inspector on object "Prompt"


This will trigger the software to run. Here is a breakdown of how it operates;

1. Input in Unity Inspector:
You provide a prompt (e.g., "How are you?") in the Unity Inspector.

2.Request Sent to Ollama:
Unity sends this prompt to Ollama's local server running on your computer via a POST request.

3. Response Generated by Ollama:
Ollama processes the prompt and generates a response (e.g., "I'm just a language model, I don't have feelings or emotions like humans.").

4. Response Returned to Unity:
Ollama sends the generated response back to Unity.

5. Unity Console:
The response is displayed in the Unity Console for you to read.

6. Log to .txt File:
The response (along with the prompt) is saved to a text file (OllamaLogs.txt) on your desktop, including a timestamp.
